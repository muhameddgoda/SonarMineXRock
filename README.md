# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction Project
![Project Image](./project_image.JPG)

## Overview

This project aims to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines using sonar data. The dataset used in this project contains sonar readings and corresponding class labels indicating whether the object is a rock (`'R'`) or a mine (`'M'`).

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

1. **sonar data.csv:** CSV file containing the sonar data, where each row corresponds to a sonar reading, and the last column represents the class label.

2. **Sonar Classification.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code and documentation for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## Instructions

### Setting up the Environment

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
